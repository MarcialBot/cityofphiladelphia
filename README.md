# City of Philadelphia

## About the Project
This website design was based on specifications provided from the assets I had received. Bulma was used for styling
the application. Vue.js was the framework used to manage components. I made various updates to some small structural details
based on my knowledge of Vue. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run serve` 

## Technologies Used
- Bulma & Bulma extensions
- Vue.js

## Requirements & Considerations
- Use Vue.js to build two pages of this website (Home, and About). Users should be able to use the navigation in the top right corner to travel between pages. The logo should link to the homepage.
- Use a CSS framework. We've imported Bulma, but if you prefer something else, swap it out.
- The content should stack on mobile (be mobile friendly).
- Items that look like links can be empty <a> tags for this assignment, if a link wasn't provided in the endpoint.
- No mobile menu is necessary.
